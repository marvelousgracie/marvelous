	<h5>Hi! I'm Marvelous!</h5>
	<p>I was born in Mandaluyong City on September 11, 2003. Right now, I'm in my second year studying Information Technology at Rizal Technological University.<br><br>Growing up in Mandaluyong has been exciting. From the lively streets to the diverse community, Mandaluyong is not just a place on the map, it's a part of who I am and I'm excited about where it leads. But life is more than just classes, I find joy everytime I spend time with my family and friends, especially when we go out, it keeps me balanced and happy<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, for me it is a portal to different worlds. From romance and fantasy, each novel is a journey, not just entertainment but insights that enrich my perspective. Of course I also watch movies and anime, each becomes experience, influencing not only my entertainment choices but also my appreciation for storytelling. Also, writing stories is not just a hobby, it's a journey of exploration. Whether crafting fictional characters, places or expressing my thoughts, writing serves as a canvas for my creativity. As well as practicing digital arts that allows me to express myself visually. From graphic design to exploring new tools and techniques, this creative outlet adds a colorful dimension to my interests.</p>
